# About
- The subject in my film is a street musician (drummer) - *Yaniv Rosenfeld*.<br />
- It was by chance that I found him performing by the beach and was lucky to be carrying my camera.<br />
- I decided to film him to capture the essence of his music and performance in the crowd, that either paused in awe or continued walking past him. <br />
- I simply wanted to convey the transcendental impact music has on the performer and the audience.
