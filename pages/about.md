## Bio

I am a documentary filmmaker and visual media artist, originally from Mumbai, **India**. Currently based in **Israel**, I am pursuing my postgraduate studies in **Film Direction and Production from The Steve Tisch School of Film and Television at Tel Aviv University**.  
Apart from pursuing a journey of experimenting in documentary cinema, I have had consistent experience with short-documentaries in traditional formats, with a niche practice in dance films as a **director/cinematographer/editor**.
